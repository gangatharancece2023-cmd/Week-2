### 🔹 Goals Completed
- Organized the dataset into 14 labeled fabric classes.
- Verified image integrity and removed corrupted or extremely blurred samples.
- Implemented preprocessing pipeline:
  - Image resizing + normalization
  - Optional tiling for large microscope images
- Added training script using EfficientNet-B0 with Transfer Learning.
- Established evaluation pipeline with confusion matrix visualization.
- Prepared a structure to save trained models and logs.

### 🧠 Model Overview
We are using **EfficientNet-B0** pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuning it to classify fabric microtextures.  
This architecture performs well for texture-based classification problems while remaining lightweight.

### 🚀 Next Goals (Week 3 Preview)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Grad-CAM explainability
- Model optimization for Raspberry Pi / Jetson edge deployment
